# Nutrition Essentials

1. A balanced diet includes lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, fiber, and plenty of water.
2. Prioritize whole foods: fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and unprocessed grains.
3. Limit added sugars, refined oils, and high-sodium processed foods.
4. Aim for at least 25–35 grams of fiber daily to support gut health.
5. Stay hydrated—roughly 30–35 ml of water per kilogram of body weight is a good starting point.
6. Eat slowly and mindfully; it improves digestion and satiety cues.
7. Protein aids muscle repair and growth. Good sources: eggs, chicken, tofu, beans, lentils, Greek yogurt.
8. Healthy fats from avocado, olive oil, and nuts support brain and hormone health.
9. Balance macros based on goals: higher protein for strength, moderate carbs for endurance, lower fats for calorie control.
10. Micronutrients—vitamins and minerals—matter as much as macros. Eat the rainbow of vegetables.
