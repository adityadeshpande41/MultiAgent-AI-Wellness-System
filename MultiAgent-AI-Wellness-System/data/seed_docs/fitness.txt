# Fitness Fundamentals

1. Consistency beats intensity. Regular moderate exercise builds endurance and strength better than infrequent extreme workouts.
2. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity weekly.
3. Always include a warm-up of light cardio and mobility work to prevent injury.
4. Strength training at least twice per week supports muscle mass, bone density, and metabolism.
5. Recovery days are essential—muscles grow and repair during rest, not during exercise.
6. Progressive overload: gradually increase resistance, time, or repetitions to keep improving.
7. Track progress through reps, sets, or perceived exertion, not just weight or body size.
8. Mix cardio and resistance training for balanced fitness.
9. Hydrate before, during, and after workouts; dehydration reduces performance.
10. Sleep 7–9 hours each night for optimal recovery and hormone balance.

# Motivation & Mindset

- Small daily progress compounds into big changes.
- Discipline sustains you when motivation fades.
- Track your workouts, celebrate milestones, and stay flexible in your approach.
